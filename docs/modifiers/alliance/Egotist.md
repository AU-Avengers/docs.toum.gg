# Egotist

#### Crewmate Alliance

The Egotist is a Crewmate Alliance modifier (signified by a dark green **#**). As the Egotist, you can **only** win if Crewmates lose, but you can still win even in death. If no crewmates remain after a meeting ends, you will leave in victory, but the game will continue.

Egotist [Snitch](/docs/roles/crewmate/investigative/Snitch) and [Mayor](/docs/roles/crewmate/power/Mayor) also reveal themselves as evil to neutrals and impostors alike, and they do not get punished when killing crewmates.
