Guide to install Town of Us: Mira via Steam on MacOS.

This guide requires that you own *Among Us* on Steam and have **[Crossover](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover/download)** installed (does not require a purchase).

**Required base game version:** v16.1.0 â€” **DOWNGRADE REQUIRED.**

***

### Mod Installation

**1.** Install Crossover and start the 14-day trial, then download Steam from the **Install a Windows Application menu**. Install *Among Us* on Steam and check that it launches successfully. If downgrading is required, do so at this point (steps below).

**2.** Download the [latest](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest) Town of Us: Mira version (look for the **-steam-itch.zip** folder). Drag the downloaded .zip folder to your desktop. 

* **Note:** Some Mac users report that it is necessary to first install [v1.0.0](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/tag/v1.0.0) in order to set-up BepInEx successfully, then update to the latest mod version.

**3.** Click the **Open C: Drive** button to open the **Finder** folder, then follow this path: 
```md
Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > common > Among Us 
```

**4.** Open the downloaded TOU  .zip folder on your desktop and copy all of the contents.

**5.** Paste the mod files into the *Among Us* folder. It should look like this example:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Install/macfolder.png')} style={{  width: '500px' }}/>
