# Epic Games
Guide to install Town of Us: Mira via Epic Games on Windows.


This guide requires that you own <i>Among Us</i> on [Epic Games](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/among-us).

**Required base game version:** v17.0.0 (latest version)

***

### Mod Installation

<b>1.</b> Download the [latest](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest) mod version (look for the **epic.msstore.zip** file).

<b>2.</b> Navigate to the Epic Games installation location (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Epic Games`). Duplicate the *Among Us* folder and rename it to something like <b>'Among Us - TOU Mira'.</b>

<b>3.</b> Extract the contents of the .zip folder you downloaded and open it. Copy all of the contents and paste them into the new TOU Mira folder. It should look like this example:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Install/miraepicNDG.png')} />

<b>4.</b> Launch the game using the <b>EpicGamesStarter.exe.</b> **Note:** You may have to launch as Administrator. 

If installed correctly, the game will launch with <b>Town of Us: Mira</b> logo displayed in the top-left corner.
