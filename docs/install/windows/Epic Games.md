Guide to install Town of Us: Mira via Epic Games on Windows.

These guides require that you own <i>Among Us</i> on [Epic Games](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/among-us). There are two options for installation; simply choose the preferred method for you!

---

### Mod Installation

<b>1.</b> Download the [latest](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest) mod version (look for the **epic.msstore.zip** file).

<b>2.</b> Navigate to the Epic Games installation location (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Epic Games`). Duplicate the _Among Us_ folder and rename it to something like <b>'Among Us - TOU Mira'.</b>

<b>3.</b> Extract the contents of the .zip folder you downloaded and open it. Copy all of the contents and paste them into the new TOU Mira folder. It should look like this example:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Install/miraepic.png')} />

<b>4.</b> Launch the game using the <i>EpicGamesStarter.exe.</i> (**Note:** You may have to launch as Administrator. )

If installed correctly, the game will launch with <b>Town of Us: Mira</b> logo displayed in the top-left corner.

### Heroic Games Launcher Installation (alternative)

**1.** If you don't already have it, [download](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/) Heroic Games Launcher. Once installed, log in to your Epic Games account and install Among Us.

**2.** Download the latest [version](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest) of Town of Us: Mira. (Download the **epic-msstore.zip** folder.)

**3.** On Heroic Games Launcher, go to **Library** and right-click Among Us and go to **Details**. On the rightside, you will see `Install Path:`. Click this to open the game directory folder.

**4.** Extract the Mira .zip folder. Copy all contents (two folders and five files) and paste them into the Among Us folder opened in Step 3. Your folder should look like the example above.

**5.** Launch the game from Heroic Games Launcher. If successful, it will show the Town of Us: Mira logo in the top left corner.
