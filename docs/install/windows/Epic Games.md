# Epic Games
Guide to install Town of Us: Mira via Epic Games on Windows.


This guide requires that you own <i>Among Us</i> on [Epic Games](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/among-us).

**Required base game version:** v17.0.0 (latest version)

***

### Mod Installation

<b>1.</b> Download the [latest](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest) mod version (look for the **epic.msstore.zip** file).

<b>2.</b> Navigate to the Epic Games installation location (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Epic Games`). Duplicate the *Among Us* folder and rename it to something like <b>'Among Us - TOU Mira'.</b>

<b>3.</b> Extract the contents of the .zip folder you downloaded and open it. Copy all of the contents and paste them into the new TOU Mira folder. It should look like this example:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Install/miraepicNDG.png')} />

<b>4.</b> Launch the game using the <b>EpicGamesStarter.exe. **Note:** You may have to launch as Administrator. 

If installed correctly, the game will launch with <b>Town of Us: Mira</b> logo displayed in the top left corner.

***
### Downgrading — Not required for v1.2.0

**1.** In the Windows search bar, search for PowerShell and open it.

**2.** Copy the following command, paste  it into PowerShell and hit Enter:
```md
iwr https://github.com/whichtwix/EpicGamesDowngrader/releases/latest/download/DowngradeEpic.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex 
```
<b>Note:</b> If you see the prompt <b>Do you want to install Among Us [Y/N]?</b>, type <b>Y</b> and hit Enter.

**3.** If successful, a new folder will open with the downgraded game version at `C:\YourName\Games\AmongUs`. If you see the **.egstore** folder, it has not downgraded correctly.

**4.** Download the [latest](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest) mod version (look for the **.epic.msstore.zip** file) and extract the contents of the folder. Copy all of the contents and paste them into the downgraded folder. It should look like this example:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Install/miraepicDG.png')} />

**5.** Launch using the **EpicGamesStarter.exe**. If the exe is missing, download it [here](https://github.com/whichtwix/EpicGamesStarter/releases/latest) and add it to the folder.

If downgraded and installed correctly, the game will launch with the **Town of Us: Mira** logo displayed in the top left corner.

<sub><b>Note:</b> After launching, if the console window shows `waiting...` over and over, check that you are logged into the Epic Games Launcher, as the downgrade process may log you out.</sub>
