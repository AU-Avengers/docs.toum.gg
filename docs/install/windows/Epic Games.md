#### Most Compatible Release: Among Us v16.1.0 (**LATEST**) + TOU Mira v1.1.1

This method will work on Windows by using the Epic Games version of Among Us.

### What you'll need

- Among Us on [Epic Games](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/among-us) running on the most compatible version of Among Us

### Setup (If Mod Is For Latest Release)

1. Find your game's install directory and duplicate the game folder. Rename it to something like "Among Us (TOU Mira)".
2 Download [this zip file](https://github.com/whichtwix/EpicGamesStarter/releases/latest), unzip it, and place the exe file inside your copied folder. Proceed to "Mod Installation".

### Setup (If Downgrade Is Required)

1. Make sure Epic Games is open and you're signed in.
2. Open the PowerShell app and run the command:
````md
iwr https://github.com/whichtwix/EpicGamesDowngrader/releases/latest/download/DowngradeEpic.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex 
````

**Note:** You may have to press "Y" a few times through the prompts on screen. Once it has finished, your downgraded folder will be at "C:\Users\[YOUR NAME]\Games\AmongUs". Proceed to "Mod Installation".

### Mod Installation

1. Download the latest version of TOU: Mira that supports Epic Games from [here](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest).
2. Extract the contents of the archive into your "Among Us (TOU Mira)" folder.
    - "Among Us.exe" and the "BepInEx" folder should both be visible in the same place.

### You're Done!

If everything was set up correctly, launching the **EpicGamesStarter.exe** file in the "Among Us (TOU Mira)" folder should open Among Us with the Town of Us logo on the home screen, replacing the original Among Us logo. Happy tasking!
