#### Most Compatible Release: Among Us Version 105 + TOU Mira v1.0.0

This method will work on Windows by using the Itch.io version of Among Us.

### What you'll need

- Among Us on [Itch.io](https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us) running on the most compatible version of Among Us
- The [Itch.io app](https://itch.io/app)

### Setup

To start, install Among Us in the itch.io app. 

If downgrading is required, go to your Library, right-click Among Us, then "Manage", then "Switch to another version...". Select the correct version here.

### Mod Installation

1. Right click on Among Us, then "Manage", then "Open folder in explorer".
1. Download the latest version of TOU: Mira that supports Itch.io from [here](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest).
2. Extract the contents of the archive into your game folder.
    - "Among Us.exe" and the "BepInEx" folder should both be visible in the same place.

### You're Done!

If everything was set up correctly, launching the **Among Us.exe** file in the "Among Us (TOU Mira)" folder should open Among Us with the Town of Us logo on the home screen, replacing the original Among Us logo. Happy tasking!
