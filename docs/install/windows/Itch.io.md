Guide to install Town of Us: Mira via Itch.io on Windows.

This guide requires that you own *Among Us* on [Itch.io](https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us) and have the [Itch.io app](https://itch.io/app) installed.

**Required base game version:** v17.0.0 â€” **NO DOWNGRADE.**
***
### Downgrading

* In your Itch.io library, right-click Among Us and click **Manage > Switch to another version...**
* Select `version 106 (September 9)`.

***

### Mod Installation

**1.** Download the [latest](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest) **Town of Us: Mira** version (download the  *steam-itch.zip* file.)

**2.** In your Itch.io library, right-click *Among Us*, then `Manage` > `Open folder in  explorer`.

**3.** Duplicate the *Among Us* folder and rename it to something like **Among Us - TOU Mira**. 

**4.** Extract the contents of the .zip file you downloaded and copy the contents. Paste the files into the TOU Mira folder. It should look like this example:
