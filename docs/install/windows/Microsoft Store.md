# Microsoft Store / Xbox App
###### Guide Written by [Atony](https://github.com/AtonyGit)

#### Most Compatible Release: Among Us v16.1.0 + TOU Mira v1.0.0

This method will work on Windows by using the Microsoft Store / Xbox App version of Among Us, but **only** if the mod can run on the latest release.

On top of that, you **cannot** make a seperate folder for Tou Mira.

### What you'll need

- Among Us on the [Microsoft Store / Xbox App](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NG07QJNK38J) or Game Pass

### Mod Installation

1. Download the latest version of TOU: Mira that supports Microsoft Store from [here](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest).
2. Go into the Xbox App and click "Manage" on Among Us.

4. Go into the folder of Among Us, then Content, until you see the game's files in the folder.

5. Extract the contents of the archive into your Content folder.
    - "Among Us.exe" and the "BepInEx" folder should both be visible in the same place.

### You're Done!

If everything was set up correctly, launching Among Us from the Xbox App should open the auto updater, then Among Us with the Town of Us logo on the home screen, replacing the original Among Us logo. Happy tasking!
