# Microsoft Store - WIP

#### Most Compatible Release: Among Us v16.1.0 + TOU Mira v0.9.81

This method will work on Windows by using the Microsoft Store / Xbox App version of Among Us, but **only** if the mod can run on the latest release.

### What you'll need

- Among Us on [Microsoft Store / Xbox](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NG07QJNK38J)

### Setup (Downgrading is not possible)

Check back later!

### Mod Installation

1. Check back later!

### You're Done!

If everything was set up correctly, launching the **Unknown** file in the "Unknown" folder should open Among Us with the Town of Us logo on the home screen, replacing the original Among Us logo. Happy tasking!
