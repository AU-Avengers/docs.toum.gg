#### Most Compatible Release: Among Us v16.1.0 (**LATEST**) + TOU Mira v1.1.1

This method will work on Windows by using the Steam version of Among Us.

### What you'll need

- Among Us on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360) running on the most compatible version of Among Us

### Setup + Downgrading (If Required)

If downgrading is required, you can do so by clicking "Properties", then "Betas", then selecting "public-beta" or "public-previous".
If the mod runs on latest, then make sure that the Beta is set to "None".

Once you've installed the game, navigate to its install folder - "Manage", then "Browse local files".
Duplicate the folder that Among Us is installed to, rename it to something like "Among Us (TOU Mira)", and proceed to the next step.

### Mod Installation

1. Download the latest version of TOU: Mira that supports Steam from [here](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest).
2. Extract the contents of the archive into your "Among Us (TOU Mira)" folder.
    - "Among Us.exe" and the "BepInEx" folder should both be visible in the same place.

### You're Done!

If everything was set up correctly, launching the **Among Us.exe** file in the "Among Us (TOU Mira)" folder should open Among Us with the Town of Us logo on the home screen, replacing the original Among Us logo. Happy tasking!
