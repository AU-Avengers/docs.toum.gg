# Steam

Guide to install Town of Us: Mira via Steam on Windows.

This guide requires that you own _Among Us_ on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360).

**Required game version:** v17.0.0 â€” **DOWNGRADING IS REQUIRED**

---

### Downgrading

- Right-click _Among Us_ on Steam, then click **Properties**.
- Click **Betas** and select `public previous` on the drop-down.

Steam should automatically update the game to the compatible version, and you can then follow the installation steps below.

---

### Mod Installation

**1.** Download the [latest](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest) Town of Us: Mira version (look for the **-steam-itch.zip** folder).

**2.** Go to your Steam library, right-click _Among Us_ and click **Manage** > **Browse Local Files**

**3.** In the File Explorer, navigate to the `common` folder and duplicate your _Among Us_ folder. Rename it to something like **Among Us - TOU Mira**.

**4.** Extract the contents of the .zip folder you downloaded and open it. Copy all the contents (two folders and five files) and paste them into the new TOU Mira folder. It should look like this example:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Install/mirasteam.png')} />

**5.** Launch the _Among Us.exe_ from that folder. If successful, it will launch with the **Town of Us: Mira** logo displayed in the top left corner.
