# Steam 
Guide to install Town of Us: Mira via Steam on Windows.

This guide requires that you own *Among Us* on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360).

**Required base game version:** v17.0.0 (latest version)

***

### Mod Installation

**1.** Download the [latest](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest) Town of Us: Mira version (look for the **steam-itch.zip** folder).

**2.** Go to your Steam library, right-click *Among Us* and click  **Manage**  >  **Browse Local Files**

**3.** In the File Explorer, navigate to the `common` folder and duplicate your *Among Us* folder. Rename it to something like **Among Us - TOU Mira**.

**4.** Extract the contents of the .zip folder you downloaded and open it. Copy all the contents (two folders and five files) and paste them into the new TOU Mira folder. It should look like this example:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Install/steammira.png')} />

**5.** Launch the *Among Us.exe* from that folder. If successful, it will launch with the **Town of Us: Mira** logo displayed in the top left corner.
