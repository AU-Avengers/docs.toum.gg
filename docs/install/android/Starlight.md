###### Guide Written by [Atony](https://github.com/AtonyGit)

#### Most Compatible Release: Among Us v16.1.0 (**LATEST**) + TOU Mira v1.0.1

This method will work on Android.

### What you'll need

- Among Us on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innersloth.spacemafia) running on the most compatible version of Among Us:
  - You may also use an alternative android app store like [F-Droid](https://www.f-droid.org/) or [Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com/files)
- Starlight on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.allofus.starlight)

### Setup + Downgrading (If Required)

If the release is not for the latest version of Among Us, you will need to downgrade Among Us itself to the most recent version that mira supports. If you are using a third party app store, this is made easier. We also recommend turning off Auto-Update if you don't intend to play Vanilla.

### Mod Installation

1. Download the latest version of TOU: Mira that supports Android from [here](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest).
2. Extract the zip file that contains TOU: Mira and its dependencies (should be MiraAPI.dll, Reactor.dll, and TownOfUs.dll) into a folder like your downloads folder.
3. Make sure to run vanilla among us at least once prior to launching the mod, and then enter the Starlight app.
4. Import all the mods that you extracted into the Mods tab of the application.

### You're Done!

If everything was set up correctly, you should see Town of Us loaded up, replacing the among us logo on the main menu.

If that is not the case, make sure you're running on a supported release of Among Us and that Starlight is up-to-date.

**Note:** If you are able to get in, but the game complains about having to use a Guest Account, make sure you have signed in with Itch.io in the Settings tab of Starlight. You do **not** need to own Among Us on Itch.io for this to work.
