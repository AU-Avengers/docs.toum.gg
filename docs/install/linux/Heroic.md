# Heroic (Epic Games)

Guide to install Town of Us: Mira via Heroic Launcher.

This guide requires that you own _Among Us_ on [Epic Games.](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/among-us)

---

### Installation

**1** Download the latest [version](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira/releases/latest) of Town of Us: Mira. (Download the **epic-msstore.zip** folder.)

**2.** On Heroic Games Launcher, in the **Wine Manager** tab, make sure that you have `Wine-GE-Latest` installed.

**3.** On the Library tab, right-click Among Us and click **Details**. This should show you a page with `Install Path:` on the right-hand side. Click that and it will open the installation folder for your game.

**4.** Extract the contents of the .zip folder you downloaded and open it. Copy all the contents (two folders and five files) and paste them into the main Among Us folder. It should look like this example:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Install/HGLinstall.png')} />

**5.** On Heroic Launcher, go to the settings menu and open **winecgf** using the provided button. Click **Libraries**, then type `wintthp` in the "New override for library:" field and then press **Add**.
