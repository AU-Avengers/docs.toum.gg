# Soul Collector

The Soul Collector is a Neutral Killing role that takes the soul of players. Instead of leaving a body behind, they leave behind an soul-less decoy that looks identical to the reaped player, standing still without life. Because of this, the Soul Collector cannot trigger Bait or Noisemaker (if specified)
