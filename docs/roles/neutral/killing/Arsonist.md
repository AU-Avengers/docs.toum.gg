# Arsonist

The Arsonist is a Neutral Killing role that wins by being the last killer alive. If Legacy Arsonist is active, they can douse players and ignite one of them to ignite all doused players on the map. Otherwise, they can douse players and ignite them only if they're within the ignite radius.
