# Haunter

### _Complete all your tasks without getting caught to reveal impostors!_

#### Alignment: Crewmate Investigative, Ghost Role

The **Haunter** is the ghost of a crewmate who must complete their tasks without being caught to reveal the Impostors to the living.

When a certain number of tasks remain, the Impostor(s) will be alerted and they will know the location of the Haunter. The Haunter must make it to the next meeting without being clicked to reveal the Impostor(s).
