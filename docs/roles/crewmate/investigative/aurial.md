# Aurial

The Aurial is a Crewmate Investigative role that will be alerted whenever a player near them uses one of their abilities.
Depending on how close a player uses an ability, the aurial will see a colored arrow pointing to the area the player was at while using said ability. Otherwise, only a white arrow is shown.
