# Haunter

The Haunter is a Crewmate Ghost role who can do tasks. They will appear as a transparent player. If they finish all their tasks, all alive players will see who the Impostors are. However, if an Impostor clicks them first, they will become a normal ghost. Impostors get a warning shortly before and when the Haunter finishes their tasks.
