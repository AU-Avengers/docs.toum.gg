# Traitor

The Traitor is an Impostor Killing role that spawns after a meeting, in which the spawn conditions are suitable. The Traitor will never be a Mayor, and must be a crewmate. The Traitor sets out to win the game for the fallen Impostors, and kill off the crew. They are also able to change to a better role.
