Hey crewmates!

We've been hard at work in preparation for Town of Us: Mira's first public release, so we have now set up a wiki here for the community, which will contain all the same information as the In-Game WIki! Neat, right?

That's not all: We also have install guides (some courtesy of [Chloe](https://totallychloe.carrd.co/)) over in the [Installation Guide](/docs/install/intro) tab, as well as some of my own.

We hope you enjoy the release of TOU Mira, and as always, give feedback or file bug reports over on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ugyc4EVUYZ), we appreciate all the feedback given to us!
